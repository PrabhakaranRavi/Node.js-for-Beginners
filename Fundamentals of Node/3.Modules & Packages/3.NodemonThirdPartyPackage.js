/**
 * you learnt how to automatically run your code without having to type the following command:

node filename
 

You added a script inside scripts in your package.json file, where the key was "start" and the value associated with the key was the following command:

node startingPointOfApplication
 

Now, in the Terminal window, you wrote the following command:

npm start
 

After that, whenever you made any changes in your file and saved it, the code written inside the file was automatically executed.

 

The actual syntax to run any script declared in package.json is:

npm run nameOfKeyInsideScript
